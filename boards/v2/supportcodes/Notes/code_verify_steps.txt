- turn on "verbose" compilation output in Arduino IDE
- click "verify"
- click "verify" again if this is the first compilation with the "verbose" setting (it'll make it much easier to find the desired dir)
- find temp directory where Arduino dumps the intermediate files
- go to that dir
- avr-objdump -S <sketch name>.cpp.elf
-- might need sudo
-- can also add "> filename.txt" to send it to a file
