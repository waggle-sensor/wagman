### Features

The WagMan V4 board is capable of managing up to 5 devices through power control, 
power monitoring, heart-beat monitoring and device temperature monitoring. The 
Wagman V4 version is a successor to the [Wagman V3](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/wagman/blob/develop/v3/README.md#wagman-layout-and-features) implemented in 2015-16 and was designed based on the features listed in the [RFC.](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/development/blob/master/WagMan_4.0_Discussion.md) Salient features of the new Wagman V4 include -
  * *Built around more capable Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU*
  * *On board 32K EEPROM*
  * *On board uSD storage slot*
  * *On board RTC*
  * *Supervisory circuits to safely reset Wagman during power glitches*
  * *SAM3X8E able to trigger self-power-cycle*
  * *Ability to power-down SAM3X8E and associated circuits completely from Node Controller and reboot*
  * *Ability to soft-reset SAM3X8E from Node Controller*
  * *Improved power distribution*
  * *UART Console and Programming Port for debugging and out-of-band wireless interaction*
  * *Support for devices with multiple input voltages and logic-levels*
  * *Voltage and Current sensing on Wagman's main power supply and individual power lines to all connected devices*
  * *Thermal monitoring of all 5 connected devices*
  * *On board temperature, humidity and light sensor for local environmental monitoring*
  * *Full UART heartbeat capability on all 5 managed channels*
  * *Node Control dead-man trigger*
  * *Latched relays for uninterrupted power to devices during Wagman reboot*
  * *10 LEDS for visual feedback*
  * *GPIO port with 5 I/O lines*
