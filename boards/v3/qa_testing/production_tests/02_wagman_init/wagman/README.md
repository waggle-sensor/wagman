*   On completion of the above step, connect the board to the QA computer using a micro-USB cable.
    __Please make sure only the Wagman under test is connected to the QA computer. No other Wagman or
    Arduino Micro/derivatives can be connected at this time.__

*   Initialize the Wagman by issuing the command *make test* in the Wagman subfolder
    and follow the on-screen prompts.

    __To exit the screen session created for the test, press Control+a, followed by k and y.__
