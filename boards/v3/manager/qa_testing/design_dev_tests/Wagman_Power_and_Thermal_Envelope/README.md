# Test Scope and Coverage

This test evaluates the following aspects of Wagman system design. </br>
1. Ability to turn on and off five 5V DC power channels.</br>
2. Ability to sense on-board power consumption.</br>
3. Ability to supply a minimum of 2A of current through each of the five ports.</br>
4. Ability to source 10A of current from AC/DC converter.</br>
5. Ability to sense power consumed by devices connected to the five power outputs.</br>
6. Ability to sustain peak power distribution over several tens of minutes without catastrophic failure.</br>
7. Ability to sense heating and temperature change of the various devices connected to the power outputs.</br>
</br>


# Test Setup Procedure

## Test Events Timeline
* Phase 1: Wagman is tested to verify its ability to turn on and off five output power channels.
* Phase 2: Wagman is tested to verify its power delivery and temperature sensing capabilities (scope items 3 to 7).

## Electrical Connection
*  Connect micro-USB cable between Wagman's J3 and QA computer.
*  Connect 5V DC power to Wagman.
*  Connect five 2 ohm resistors (20 watt dissipation) to the five output ports (J5, J6, J7, J8 and J9)
    between +5V (pin 2) and GND (pin 4).
*  Connect the two leads of the thermistors to PINS 5 and 6 of J5, J6, J7, J8 and J9 as shown below.</br>

*  Secure the five thermistor bulbs to the five resistor loads such that the bulbs are heated by the
    resistors. The thermistor bulbs can be secured using heat resistant tape.</br>

__Please make sure only the Wagman under test is connected to the QA computer. No other Wagman or Arduino Micro/derivatives can be connected at this time.__

## Testing Procedure
*  Start test by issuing the command *make run* and follow the on-screen prompts.
__To exit the screen session created for the test, press Control+a, followed by k and y.__

## Test Log
This test pushes Wagman to 125% of the design requirements, drawing 12.5 watts on each of the five output channels.

The test was conducted for several hours and the system was stable. The test was conducted at an ambient temperature of 70-80F, 
no forced air movement was used and the thermal camera (used for the image above) does not sense beyond 302F. All temperatures 
are in degree F in the above image.
