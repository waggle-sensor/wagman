/** \defgroup avr_io <avr/io.h>: AVR device-specific IO definitions
    \code #include <avr/io.h> \endcode

    This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the
    device that has been specified by the <tt>-mmcu=</tt> compiler
    command-line switch.  This is done by diverting to the appropriate
    file <tt>&lt;avr/io</tt><em>XXXX</em><tt>.h&gt;</tt> which should
    never be included directly.  Some register names common to all
    AVR devices are defined directly within <tt>&lt;avr/common.h&gt;</tt>,
    which is included in <tt>&lt;avr/io.h&gt;</tt>,
    but most of the details come from the respective include file.

    Note that this file always includes the following files:
    \code 
    #include <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    #include <avr/portpins.h>
    #include <avr/common.h>
    #include <avr/version.h>
    \endcode
    See \ref avr_sfr for more details about that header file.

    Included are definitions of the IO register set and their
    respective bit values as specified in the Atmel documentation.
    Note that inconsistencies in naming conventions,
    so even identical functions sometimes get different names on
    different devices.

    Also included are the specific names useable for interrupt
    function definitions as documented
    \ref avr_signames "here".

    Finally, the following macros are defined:

    - \b RAMEND
    <br>
    The last on-chip RAM address.
    <br>
    - \b XRAMEND
    <br>
    The last possible RAM location that is addressable. This is equal to 
    RAMEND for devices that do not allow for external RAM. For devices 
    that allow external RAM, this will be larger than RAMEND.
    <br>
    - \b E2END
    <br>
    The last EEPROM address.
    <br>
    - \b FLASHEND
    <br>
    The last byte address in the Flash program space.
    <br>
    - \b SPM_PAGESIZE
    <br>
    For devices with bootloader support, the flash pagesize
    (in bytes) to be used for the \c SPM instruction. 
    - \b E2PAGESIZE
    <br>
    The size of the EEPROM page.

/* avr/sfr_defs.h - macros for accessing AVR special function registers */

/* $Id$ */




/** \defgroup avr_sfr_notes Additional notes from <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    \ingroup avr_sfr

   The \c <avr/sfr_defs.h> file is included by all of the \c <avr/ioXXXX.h>
   files, which use macros defined here to make the special function register
   definitions look like C variables or simple constants, depending on the
   <tt>_SFR_ASM_COMPAT</tt> define.  Some examples from \c <avr/iocanxx.h> to
   show how to define such macros:

\code
#define PORTA   _SFR_IO8(0x02)
#define EEAR    _SFR_IO16(0x21)
#define UDR0    _SFR_MEM8(0xC6)
#define TCNT3   _SFR_MEM16(0x94)
#define CANIDT  _SFR_MEM32(0xF0)
\endcode

   If \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT is not defined, C programs can use names like
   <tt>PORTA</tt> directly in C expressions (also on the left side of
   assignment operators) and GCC will do the right thing (use short I/O
   instructions if possible).  The \c __SFR_OFFSET definition is not used in
   any way in this case.

   Define \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT as 1 to make these names work as simple constants
   (addresses of the I/O registers).  This is necessary when included in
   preprocessed assembler (*.S) source files, so it is done automatically if
   \c __ASSEMBLER__ is defined.  By default, all addresses are defined as if
   they were memory addresses (used in \c lds/sts instructions).  To use these
   addresses in \c in/out instructions, you must subtract 0x20 from them.

   For more backwards compatibility, insert the following at the start of your
   old assembler source file:

\code
#define __SFR_OFFSET 0
\endcode

   This automatically subtracts 0x20 from I/O space addresses, but it's a
   hack, so it is recommended to change your source: wrap such addresses in
   macros defined here, as shown below.  After this is done, the
   <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> definition is no longer necessary and can be removed.

   Real example - this code could be used in a boot loader that is portable
   between devices with \c SPMCR at different addresses.

\verbatim
<avr/iom163.h>: #define SPMCR _SFR_IO8(0x37)
<avr/iom128.h>: #define SPMCR _SFR_MEM8(0x68)
\endverbatim

\code
#if _SFR_IO_REG_P(SPMCR)
	out	_SFR_IO_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
#else
	sts	_SFR_MEM_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
#endif
\endcode

   You can use the \c in/out/cbi/sbi/sbic/sbis instructions, without the
   <tt>_SFR_IO_REG_P</tt> test, if you know that the register is in the I/O
   space (as with \c SREG, for example).  If it isn't, the assembler will
   complain (I/O address out of range 0...0x3f), so this should be fairly
   safe.

   If you do not define \c __SFR_OFFSET (so it will be 0x20 by default), all
   special register addresses are defined as memory addresses (so \c SREG is
   0x5f), and (if code size and speed are not important, and you don't like
   the ugly \#if above) you can always use lds/sts to access them.  But, this
   will not work if <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> != 0x20, so use a different macro
   (defined only if <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> == 0x20) for safety:

\code
	sts	_SFR_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
\endcode

   In C programs, all 3 combinations of \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT and
   <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> are supported - the \c _SFR_ADDR(SPMCR) macro can be
   used to get the address of the \c SPMCR register (0x57 or 0x68 depending on
   device). */

/** \defgroup avr_inttypes <inttypes.h>: Integer Type conversions
    \code #include <inttypes.h> \endcode

    This header file includes the exact-width integer definitions from
    <tt><stdint.h></tt>, and extends them with additional facilities
    provided by the implementation.

    Currently, the extensions include two additional integer types
    that could hold a "far" pointer (i.e. a code pointer that can
    address more than 64 KB), as well as standard names for all printf
    and scanf formatting options that are supported by the \ref avr_stdio.
    As the library does not support the full range of conversion
    specifiers from ISO 9899:1999, only those conversions that are
    actually implemented will be listed here.

    The idea behind these conversion macros is that, for each of the
    types defined by <stdint.h>, a macro will be supplied that portably
    allows formatting an object of that type in printf() or scanf()
    operations.  Example:

    \code
    #include <inttypes.h>

    uint8_t smallval;
    int32_t longval;
    ...
    printf("The hexadecimal value of smallval is %" PRIx8
           ", the decimal value of longval is %" PRId32 ".\n",
	   smallval, longval);
    \endcode
*/

/** \defgroup avr_fuse <avr/fuse.h>: Fuse Support

    \par Introduction

    The Fuse API allows a user to specify the fuse settings for the specific
    AVR device they are compiling for. These fuse settings will be placed
    in a special section in the ELF output file, after linking.

    Programming tools can take advantage of the fuse information embedded in
    the ELF file, by extracting this information and determining if the fuses
    need to be programmed before programming the Flash and EEPROM memories.
    This also allows a single ELF file to contain all the
    information needed to program an AVR. 

    To use the Fuse API, include the <avr/io.h> header file, which in turn
    automatically includes the individual I/O header file and the <avr/fuse.h>
    file. These other two files provides everything necessary to set the AVR
    fuses.
    
    \par Fuse API
    
    Each I/O header file must define the FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE macro which is
    defined to the number of fuse bytes that exist in the AVR device.
    
    A new type, __fuse_t, is defined as a structure. The number of fields in 
    this structure are determined by the number of fuse bytes in the 
    FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE macro.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 1, there is only a single field: byte, of type
    unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 2, there are two fields: low, and high, of type
    unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 3, there are three fields: low, high, and extended,
    of type unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE > 3, there is a single field: byte, which is an array
    of unsigned char with the size of the array being FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE.
    
    A convenience macro, FUSEMEM, is defined as a GCC attribute for a 
    custom-named section of ".fuse".
    
    A convenience macro, FUSES, is defined that declares a variable, __fuse, of
    type __fuse_t with the attribute defined by FUSEMEM. This variable
    allows the end user to easily set the fuse data.

    \note If a device-specific I/O header file has previously defined FUSEMEM,
    then FUSEMEM is not redefined. If a device-specific I/O header file has
    previously defined FUSES, then FUSES is not redefined.

    Each AVR device I/O header file has a set of defined macros which specify the
    actual fuse bits available on that device. The AVR fuses have inverted
    values, logical 1 for an unprogrammed (disabled) bit and logical 0 for a
    programmed (enabled) bit. The defined macros for each individual fuse
    bit represent this in their definition by a bit-wise inversion of a mask.
    For example, the FUSE_EESAVE fuse in the ATmega128 is defined as:
    \code
    #define FUSE_EESAVE      ~_BV(3)
    \endcode
    \note The _BV macro creates a bit mask from a bit number. It is then 
    inverted to represent logical values for a fuse memory byte.
    
    To combine the fuse bits macros together to represent a whole fuse byte,
    use the bitwise AND operator, like so:
    \code
    (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN)
    \endcode
    
    Each device I/O header file also defines macros that provide default values
    for each fuse byte that is available. LFUSE_DEFAULT is defined for a Low
    Fuse byte. HFUSE_DEFAULT is defined for a High Fuse byte. EFUSE_DEFAULT
    is defined for an Extended Fuse byte.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE > 3, then the I/O header file defines macros that
    provide default values for each fuse byte like so:
    FUSE0_DEFAULT
    FUSE1_DEFAULT
    FUSE2_DEFAULT
    FUSE3_DEFAULT
    FUSE4_DEFAULT
    ....
    
    \par API Usage Example
    
    Putting all of this together is easy. Using C99's designated initializers:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    FUSES = 
    {
        .low = LFUSE_DEFAULT,
        .high = (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN),
        .extended = EFUSE_DEFAULT,
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    Or, using the variable directly instead of the FUSES macro,
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    __fuse_t __fuse __attribute__((section (".fuse"))) = 
    {
        .low = LFUSE_DEFAULT,
        .high = (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN),
        .extended = EFUSE_DEFAULT,
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    If you are compiling in C++, you cannot use the designated intializers so
    you must do:

    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    FUSES = 
    {
        LFUSE_DEFAULT, // .low
        (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN), // .high
        EFUSE_DEFAULT, // .extended
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    
    However there are a number of caveats that you need to be aware of to
    use this API properly.
    
    Be sure to include <avr/io.h> to get all of the definitions for the API.
    The FUSES macro defines a global variable to store the fuse data. This 
    variable is assigned to its own linker section. Assign the desired fuse 
    values immediately in the variable initialization.
    
    The .fuse section in the ELF file will get its values from the initial 
    variable assignment ONLY. This means that you can NOT assign values to 
    this variable in functions and the new values will not be put into the
    ELF .fuse section.
    
    The global variable is declared in the FUSES macro has two leading 
    underscores, which means that it is reserved for the "implementation",
    meaning the library, so it will not conflict with a user-named variable.
    
    You must initialize ALL fields in the __fuse_t structure. This is because
    the fuse bits in all bytes default to a logical 1, meaning unprogrammed. 
    Normal uninitialized data defaults to all locgial zeros. So it is vital that
    all fuse bytes are initialized, even with default data. If they are not,
    then the fuse bits may not programmed to the desired settings.
    
    Be sure to have the -mmcu=<em>device</em> flag in your compile command line and
    your linker command line to have the correct device selected and to have 
    the correct I/O header file included when you include <avr/io.h>.

    You can print out the contents of the .fuse section in the ELF file by
    using this command line:
    \code
    avr-objdump -s -j .fuse <ELF file>
    \endcode
    The section contents shows the address on the left, then the data going from
    lower address to a higher address, left to right.

/** \defgroup avr_lock <avr/lock.h>: Lockbit Support

    \par Introduction

    The Lockbit API allows a user to specify the lockbit settings for the 
    specific AVR device they are compiling for. These lockbit settings will be 
    placed in a special section in the ELF output file, after linking.

    Programming tools can take advantage of the lockbit information embedded in
    the ELF file, by extracting this information and determining if the lockbits
    need to be programmed after programming the Flash and EEPROM memories.
    This also allows a single ELF file to contain all the
    information needed to program an AVR. 

    To use the Lockbit API, include the <avr/io.h> header file, which in turn
    automatically includes the individual I/O header file and the <avr/lock.h>
    file. These other two files provides everything necessary to set the AVR
    lockbits.
    
    \par Lockbit API
    
    Each I/O header file may define up to 3 macros that controls what kinds
    of lockbits are available to the user.
    
    If __LOCK_BITS_EXIST is defined, then two lock bits are available to the
    user and 3 mode settings are defined for these two bits.
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BITS_0_EXIST is defined, then the two BLB0 lock bits are
    available to the user and 4 mode settings are defined for these two bits.
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BITS_1_EXIST is defined, then the two BLB1 lock bits are
    available to the user and 4 mode settings are defined for these two bits.

    If __BOOT_LOCK_APPLICATION_TABLE_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits
    are available to set the locking mode for the Application Table Section 
    (which is used in the XMEGA family).
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_APPLICATION_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits are
    available to set the locking mode for the Application Section (which is used
    in the XMEGA family).
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BOOT_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits are available
    to set the locking mode for the Boot Loader Section (which is used in the
    XMEGA family).

    The AVR lockbit modes have inverted values, logical 1 for an unprogrammed 
    (disabled) bit and logical 0 for a programmed (enabled) bit. The defined 
    macros for each individual lock bit represent this in their definition by a 
    bit-wise inversion of a mask. For example, the LB_MODE_3 macro is defined 
    as:
    \code
    #define LB_MODE_3  (0xFC)
`   \endcode
    
    To combine the lockbit mode macros together to represent a whole byte,
    use the bitwise AND operator, like so:
    \code
    (LB_MODE_3 & BLB0_MODE_2)
    \endcode
    
    <avr/lock.h> also defines a macro that provides a default lockbit value:
    LOCKBITS_DEFAULT which is defined to be 0xFF.

    See the AVR device specific datasheet for more details about these
    lock bits and the available mode settings.
    
    A convenience macro, LOCKMEM, is defined as a GCC attribute for a 
    custom-named section of ".lock".
    
    A convenience macro, LOCKBITS, is defined that declares a variable, __lock, 
    of type unsigned char with the attribute defined by LOCKMEM. This variable
    allows the end user to easily set the lockbit data.

    \note If a device-specific I/O header file has previously defined LOCKMEM,
    then LOCKMEM is not redefined. If a device-specific I/O header file has
    previously defined LOCKBITS, then LOCKBITS is not redefined. LOCKBITS is
    currently known to be defined in the I/O header files for the XMEGA devices.

    \par API Usage Example
    
    Putting all of this together is easy:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    LOCKBITS = (LB_MODE_1 & BLB0_MODE_3 & BLB1_MODE_4);

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    Or:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    unsigned char __lock __attribute__((section (".lock"))) = 
        (LB_MODE_1 & BLB0_MODE_3 & BLB1_MODE_4);

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    
    
    However there are a number of caveats that you need to be aware of to
    use this API properly.
    
    Be sure to include <avr/io.h> to get all of the definitions for the API.
    The LOCKBITS macro defines a global variable to store the lockbit data. This 
    variable is assigned to its own linker section. Assign the desired lockbit 
    values immediately in the variable initialization.
    
    The .lock section in the ELF file will get its values from the initial 
    variable assignment ONLY. This means that you can NOT assign values to 
    this variable in functions and the new values will not be put into the
    ELF .lock section.
    
    The global variable is declared in the LOCKBITS macro has two leading 
    underscores, which means that it is reserved for the "implementation",
    meaning the library, so it will not conflict with a user-named variable.
    
    You must initialize the lockbit variable to some meaningful value, even
    if it is the default value. This is because the lockbits default to a 
    logical 1, meaning unprogrammed. Normal uninitialized data defaults to all 
    locgial zeros. So it is vital that all lockbits are initialized, even with 
    default data. If they are not, then the lockbits may not programmed to the 
    desired settings and can possibly put your device into an unrecoverable 
    state.
    
    Be sure to have the -mmcu=<em>device</em> flag in your compile command line and
    your linker command line to have the correct device selected and to have 
    the correct I/O header file included when you include <avr/io.h>.

/** \defgroup avr_watchdog <avr/wdt.h>: Watchdog timer handling
    \code #include <avr/wdt.h> \endcode

    This header file declares the interface to some inline macros
    handling the watchdog timer present in many AVR devices.  In order
    to prevent the watchdog timer configuration from being
    accidentally altered by a crashing application, a special timed
    sequence is required in order to change it.  The macros within
    this header file handle the required sequence automatically
    before changing any value.  Interrupts will be disabled during
    the manipulation.

    \note Depending on the fuse configuration of the particular
    device, further restrictions might apply, in particular it might
    be disallowed to turn off the watchdog timer.

    Note that for newer devices (ATmega88 and newer, effectively any
    AVR that has the option to also generate interrupts), the watchdog
    timer remains active even after a system reset (except a power-on
    condition), using the fastest prescaler value (approximately 15
    ms).  It is therefore required to turn off the watchdog early
    during program startup, the datasheet recommends a sequence like
    the following:

    \code
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <avr/wdt.h>

    uint8_t mcusr_mirror __attribute__ ((section (".noinit")));

    void get_mcusr(void)       __attribute__((naked))       __attribute__((section(".init3")));
));
    void get_mcusr(void)
    {
      mcusr_mirror = MCUSR;
      MCUSR = 0;
      wdt_disable();
    }
    \endcode

    Saving the value of MCUSR in \c mcusr_mirror is only needed if the
    application later wants to examine the reset source, but in particular, 
    clearing the watchdog reset flag before disabling the
    watchdog is required, according to the datasheet.

   a negligible change.

   Possible timeout values are: 15 ms, 30 ms, 60 ms, 120 ms, 250 ms,
   500 ms, 1 s, 2 s.  (Some devices also allow for 4 s and 8 s.)
   Symbolic constants are formed by the prefix
   \c WDTO_, followed by the time.

   Example that would select a watchdog timer expiry of approximately
   500 ms:
   \code
   wdt_enable(WDTO_500MS);
   \endcode
