# Wagman v5

Wagman [v5](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/wagman/raw/master/boards/v5/resources/wagman_v5.jpg) also known as Tamagotchi v1.0 is the 5th generation Wagman that implements all features through hardware circuits. This version of the Wagman is designed to work with Connect Tech's [Photon AI Camera platform](https://connecttech.com/product/photon-jetson-nano-ai-camera-platform/) for NVIDIA [Xavier NX](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-xavier-nx) class of SOCs. The Wagman extends power-control features by taking advantage of the capabilities of the [RCB600](https://www.trcelectronics.com/efore-roal-modular-power-supply-rcb600) class of modular DC power-supplies. Some of the salient features include:
- Onboard TPH sensor (BME280)
- On-board RTC
- On-board EEPROM
- Support for Three Tri-color LEDs for device status and feedback
- I2C sensor extensibility 
- Deadman's trigger for resilience
