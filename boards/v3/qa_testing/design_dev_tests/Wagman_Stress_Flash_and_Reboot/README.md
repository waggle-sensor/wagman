# Test Scope and Coverage

This test evaluates the following aspects of Wagman system design. </br>
1. Ability to sustain Odroid XU4 and C1+ under full CPU load (and hence current utilization).</br>
2. Ability to boot XU4 when C1+ is drawing maximum current.</br>
3. Ability to flash Wagman from C1+.</br>
4. Repeatability and predictability of the above.</br>
</br>

# Test Setup Procedure

This test involves a XU4, C1+ and Wagman, with the following logic programmed into each of them -

* Wagman: 
    1. Boot up.
    2. Turn off any ports that are on. There is a small delay here to allow the C1+ to gracefully shutdown after re-flashing the Wagman.
    3. Power on C1+.
    4. Power on XU4.
    5. Wait in infinite loop, flashing leds.

* C1+:
    1. Start startup.sh shell script on booting using init.d stress-test script.
    2. Notify of start of stress test.
    3. Perform CPU and Disk I/O stress test for 180 seconds.
    4. Notify completion of stress test.
    5. Re-flash the wagman with the same firmware.
    6. On successful flashing, shutdown.
    7. If flashing is unsuccessful, stay on.

* XU4:
    1. Start startup.sh shell script on booting using init.d stress-test script.
    2. Notify of start of stress test.
    3. Perform CPU and Disk I/O stress test for 180 seconds.
    4. Notify completion of stress test.
    5. Shutdown

For step by step setup procedure to have the devices setup for the test, follow README files in the Wagman and Odroid sub-folders.

## Electrical Connection

After setting up the 3 devices, follow the procedure below to start the test (for orientation details, follow Wagman
electrical hookup guide {incomplete})-

* Connect C1+ power pigtail to Port 1 (J9) of Wagman
* Connect XU4 power pigtail to Port 2 (J5) of Wagman
* Connect a USB-Ethernet dongle to bottom-right USB port of C1+ and connect to Internet
* Connect a USB-Ethernet dongle to bottom port of the stacked USB connector of the XU4
* Connect barrel power connectors originating from Wagman to XU4 and C1+
* Connect one end of the micro-USB cable to J3 of Wagman and the other end to one of the remaining 3 ports of the C1+
* Connect the two USB-Ethernet dongles to network.
* Connect DC power cables to Wagman's J10 port.
* Power on Wagman.

At this point in time, the test has begun and the stress, reflash, reboot loop should continue indefinitely.



## Test Events Timeline
* T = 0      : Wagman Boots
* Boot + 35s : Wagman turns off all the ports (if in on state earlier), including C1+
* Boot + X1s : Wagman boots C1+
* Boot + X2s : C1+ starts stress
* Boot + X3s : Wagman boots XU4
* Boot + X4s : XU4 starts stress
* Boot + X5s : C1+ finishes stress
* Boot + X6s : XU4 finishes stress
* Boot + X7s : XU4 shutsdown
* Boot + X8s : C1+ starts Wagman re-flash
* Boot + X10s : Wagman reboots
* Boot + X11s : C1+ shutsdown (if re-flash successful, else stays powered on.)
* Boot + X12s : Wagman turns off all the ports, including C1+

###Success Criteria

The test was successfully performed multiple number of times, and each time the process loop ran for several hours and with more than 20 loops consistently. A thermal image of the test is included below.

The test was conducted at an ambient temperature of 70-80F, no forced air movement was used and the thermal camera 
(used for the image above) does not sense beyond 302F. All temperatures are in degree F in the above image.
